# ai-visibility

Monthly measurement loop for one goal: robertritacca.com findable on the first page for its target queries, by search engines and by AI assistants. The individual instruments already exist — this loop runs them together on a cadence and keeps the trend, because a single ranking check is an anecdote and the same check monthly is a direction. **The trend report is the deliverable. Off-property actions are proposals only, and nothing pushes, merges, or deploys.**

## Target queries

This list is the loop's one owned fact — edit it here deliberately, never inline in a run:

- `product designer Toronto AI`
- `AI product designer Toronto`
- `Rob Ritacca`
- `Rob Ritacca designer`

## When invoked

Run when asked to "run the AI visibility loop" (`/ai-visibility`), or by a scheduled task once one is created.

## Scope guardrails (read first)

- **Measurement first.** A run that changes nothing but records the numbers is the normal case, not a failure.
- **On-site fixes go only through the `seo-audit` skill**, under its own guardrails (behind-the-scenes only, crawl-policy changes report-only, branch `seo/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>`). This loop adds no second editing path.
- **No copy written for rankings.** Words on the site exist for readers and follow `content-design.md`; a ranking motive never justifies a keyword-shaped sentence. Copy changes belong to the growth loop, driven by engagement data.
- **Off-property moves are proposals.** Directory listings, backlinks, profile updates, posting anywhere — named in the report with a reason, never performed.

## The loop

### 0. Read the trend

Read the previous `ai-visibility-*.md` reports in `ga-analysis/loop-reports/` (git-ignored, local-only) — the run-over-run comparison is the whole point. Also check for unmerged `seo/*` branches from earlier runs; an unmerged fix still pending is context, not something to redo. First run: this report becomes the baseline, and say so.

### 1. Sweep the technical surface

Run the `seo-audit` skill (`.claude/skills/seo-audit/SKILL.md`). It owns the metadata/sitemap/robots/structured-data checks, fixes the safely-fixable on its own branch, and reports — fold its outcome into this run's report rather than repeating its work.

### 2. Pull the discovery traffic

Pull GA with the `ga-report` skill's judgment (it owns the bot list and baselines; it and the GA venv live on Rob's Mac). The slice this loop cares about: organic search sessions and their landing pages, plus referrals from AI surfaces — chatgpt.com, perplexity.ai, gemini.google.com, claude.ai and kin. Note the blind spot in the report: agents fetching `llms.txt` or calling MCP never execute the analytics snippet, so GA structurally undercounts agent traffic. Absence of AI referrals is weak evidence of absence.

### 3. Probe the agent surfaces from outside

Live requests against production, as a stranger's agent would make them: `https://www.robertritacca.com/llms.txt` returns 200 and every link it advertises resolves; the MCP endpoint answers a standard MCP `tools/list` POST (`MCP_ENDPOINT` in `website/src/lib/mcp-clients.ts` owns the URL). These surfaces are how an AI assistant learns the site exists — a quiet regression here is invisible to every other check, including GA.

### 4. Rank the target queries

Web-search each target query and record where robertritacca.com lands (position, or "not in the first page"), plus which competing results outrank it. Then the AI half: ask an assistant-shaped question per query ("who is Rob Ritacca, the product designer?" and one query-phrased variant) via web search and note whether the site is cited or paraphrased. Record the method beside the numbers — rankings are noisy and personalized, and the trend only means something when consecutive runs measured the same way.

### 5. Report

Save to `ga-analysis/loop-reports/ai-visibility-YYYY-MM-DD.md` **and** repeat in full in the final message. Plain English, four parts: the **trend table** (this run beside the previous ones — rankings, organic sessions, AI referrals, agent-surface status), **what changed** since last run and the likely why, **what the seo-audit leg did** (its branch, if any), and **proposals** — the off-property moves that would help, each with its reason, for the user to act on or ignore. End with the reminder that nothing is pushed or deployed.
